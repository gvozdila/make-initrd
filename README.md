# make-initrd [![Integration Tests](https://github.com/osboot/make-initrd/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/osboot/make-initrd/actions/workflows/integration.yml)

make-initrd is a new, uevent-driven initramfs infrastructure based around udev.

The make-initrd is intended for creating initramfs images. The project consists of two main parts:
- utility for creating initramfs;
- utilities running inside the image at boot time.

Utility of imaging has a modular structure. Its main idea is that to create the image you need
(in the simplest case) to specify a list of characteristics (features) of the future image.
The order of features does not matter. The user is not required to know how and in what order
will apply stage.

## Build requires
